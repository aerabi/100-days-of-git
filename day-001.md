# Day 1
Very often, when I was editing a Word file, I would create countless different versions of it:

- Article.doc
- Article v1.doc
- Article v1 final.doc
- Article v1 F2.doc
- Article v1 F3.doc
- Article v2 final.doc
- Article v2 postfinal.doc

And at the end of the day I was confused which file is the _real_ final version.

Version control tools are here to help you with that problem.

As for today's lession, let's create a directory and initialize version controlling for it.
Usually, I have a `Dev` directory under my home and I put all my development stuff in there. I would create a directory called `one-git` under it:

```shell
cd ~/Dev
mkdir one-git
```

Now let's change the directory to this newly created `one-git` and then initialize version controlling in there:

```shell
cd one-git
git init
```

In the newer versions of git, upon your first time doing a `git init`, it will ask you to choose a default branch name.
Since recently, the default name was always `master`. Now git gives you the choice. To choose a default branch name, one has to set the config beforehand. The current trends for a default branch name also include `main`, `trunk`, or `develop`.

I would set the option to make `master` the default branch name for consistency:

```shell
git config --global init.defaultBranch master
```

After the config is set, you need to run the `git init` command once more.

After a successful execution of the init command, a `.git` directory is created in your `one-git` directory. From now on, every change under this directory is tracked by git. Also, this directory is now called a _repository_ from now on.

## Notes

- Never do `git init` inside a directory that you have not created. E.g. initializing a git repo inside the home directory `~` or on a hard drive main directory is absolutely discouraged.
- Once a `git init` is executed, every subdirectory is also tracked by git. Be careful not doing another `git init` inside a git repo.
