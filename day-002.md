# Day 2

On day 1, we have created a git repo. That's an environment where you can track your changes. But, to track a change, one needs to instruct git to do so.

Let's get our hands dirty. I'll create a file in the repo that we have:

```shell
echo "# Hello World!" >> Hello.md
```

This command creates a file named `Hello.md` and populates it with the content `# Hello World!`. Now, let's tell git that we want this change to be _recorded_:

```shell
git add Hello.md
git commit -m "Create Hello.md"
```

Commits are units of "change" that we record using git. Here we had a change, that was a file with some content was created. It's a change, because the file was not there before.
Then, we instructed git to _record_ this change, using the commit command.

This is how the commit command works:

- We first say which files we want to commit. This is done using the add command.
- We then commit the added files and give it a message.
